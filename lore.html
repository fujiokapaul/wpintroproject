                <p>A planet that should no longer be. Torn asunder by the shunned Archmage Keryth Valakyn, advisor and brother to the elven king Akkanor. The planet was saved by the 5 Heroes of The Leyline, or as some may know them...The Funky Bunch. Nobody knows how or why, but The Severing all began when Keryth discovered a way to turn souls into energy. In his research he found the souls provided more energy if they were pulled from the body while the host was in great distress, and could provide even more energy when the soul was then fractured and mixed with others. Discovery of his brother's uncharacteristic and dark research broke King Akkanor's heart. He begged his brother to cease his research but Keryth would pay him no mind. A bloody battle broke out between the brothers. Akkanor utterly defeated and near death, as a last resort he opened a portal to the place between Planes, The Imperceptive Infinity. The chaotic energies of the in-between would rip any mortal asunder. Unbeknownst to Akkanor and even Keryth himself, he had the spark which allowed him to exist here. The Imperceptive Infinite has glimpses into other realms, and from here Keryth furthered his research. He slowly built up a mass of microscopic constructs, which many have dubbed senti-metal, that moved as a fluid but could be hardened like steel. During his research and one of his many visits to the planes he discovered how to get back to Klong't'd't, he needed to transpose a mass of equal size on top of it. After much time he finally generated enough and the resulting teleportation was devestating. Two equal sized masses trying to fit in the same area caused the planet to sever in half completely, the seismic energy released from this caused massive earthquakes and eruptions that would level every  settlement. Helig, Kerrigant, Lugh, Shan'do, and Alaric rushed to defeat Keryth and his construct army while also trying to figure out a way to keep the planet from drifting apart. After successfully subduing Keryth, Kerrigant made the ultimate sacrifice. He gave up his physical form and gave Shan'do his energy to form a tree big enough to hold a planet together. Even after their great sacrifice, it was not all over. The many races always got along before the Severing, but an unease spread among them and they began pointing fingers at the elves. Tensions grew until a great war between the Elves and the newly form Alliance broke out. After one hundred years, both sides grew tired of fighting and a weak peace treaty was signed, forcing the Elves to their own side of the planet while the Alliance lived on their own. It has been hundreds of years since then and not many are alive today that remember the great sacrifice of The 5 Heroes, but if you ever need to be reminded, take a look to The Tree of K'life, or as it has also come to be commonly known, The Star Kisser.</p>
